Welcome to the repository of the Portland, Oregon based Meetup
associated with Emacs.

   We get together to share our exciting new discoveries about Emacs and
   its multitudinous ecosystem. We also offer assistance to those who
   have brought Emacs questions along.

   Both Emacs wizards and Emacs novices are welcome. Even Vim users are
   welcome, but we cannot guarantee they will want to remain Vim users at
   the end of the session.

This repository contains documents, notes, and a small collection of
magical incantations related to our organization.

More to come ... Happy Hacking.
