#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hey there, Hackers!

Thanks so much for joining the group. I love that we have so much
local interest. I realize that our kickoff/brainstorming session is
starting a bit too quickly for most people, so if you can't meet
tomorrow, but have some ideas/suggestions to pitch, perhaps use
this Discussion page to post them?

See many of you tomorrow, and the rest of you next month!
Hacker Howard

  And for those Hackers that came out this evening, /Thanks for
  coming!/ I appreciate the feedback and suggestions. Feel free to
  submit pull requests to this repository to help correct the
  following notes.

* Introductions

  Attendees for tonight's kickoff included:

  - Howard Abrams, who was hoping to get a group buy on Emacs stickers for his laptop.
  - Chris Freeman, who was looking for tips and tricks to using Emacs.
  - Will Clifford, who would like to help new people get started and discuss
    various workflows surrounding Emacs.
  - Micah Cowan, who is an old vi user wanting to switch, but make the
    startup time to Emacs quicker... or at least, better integration with tmux.
  - William (the other Will) is a seasoned hacker, but new to Emacs.

* Business

  Monthly, predictable meetings are the best... but when?  Chris
  Freeman came up a [[http://chrisfreeman.github.io/calagator_2015.html][first pass at a Calagator analysis]].  Meetings are
  sorted into reoccurring categories by day of the week and week of
  the month.

  We decided that the *Third Wednesday* of each month is the best.
  This means that Oct 21st at 6:30pm will be our next meeting.

* Normal Structure and Agenda

  At EmacsConf 2015, Harry Schwartz mentioned how important it was to
  establish a regular /structure/ to each meeting, but what should be
  that entail? We discussed quite a few options, including:

  - Larger presentations or tutorials?
    - Pro: Very useful and often worthy of recording and transmitting
    - Con: Time consuming for the presenter, so hard to get monthly speakers
  - Short segments around 15 minutes?
    - Pro: Useful, but easier to produce
    - Con: Compelling enough to bring people out?
  - Lightning talks
    - Pro: Very easy to produce
    - Con: Can be disjointed, but can we get enough people each month?
  - Quick tips and tricks?
    - See lightning talks
  - Should we do a /Round Table/ that includes “what I’ve learned”
    this month?
  - Office hours
    - Pro: Works well in a bar and can be very focused
    - Con: Seems like we aren't trying. ;-)
  - New Person's Night
    - Similar to Office Hours where people post questions what they
      need and others are around to answer.

  We decided to do everything, so next month's agenda will be:

  - 15 minute presentation (we'll start with an Introduction to Magit)
    - How to get started.
    - The /Why/ one would want to play with the technology.
    - How to keep going, including learning resources.
  - Lightning talks.
    - What did you learn this month? Care to show it off?
    - We'll have a before-meeting signup
  - Office Hours
    - Will, if we can use his office space, will supply a whiteboard
    - One side will be problems or other issues one wants to fix
    - The other will be other topics or projects that people are
      working on.

* Technical Aspects

  - Find a space with a projector and seating.
    - Will going to check with CrowdCompass for space
  - Remote viewing?
    - Google hangout or other group chat
    - Video cameras?
    - Decided that we may not have enough attendees to justify this
      effort at this time, but that may change.
  - Worth summarizing how to get started with Emacs
    - Chris Freeman may work on an initial pass at reference links.
  - Other more-regular communication?
    - IRC channel? #pdx-emacs
    - Twitter hashtag? #pdx-emacs

* Possible Topics

  - Language-specific Tutorials, e.g. Python, Ruby, Clojure
    - Invite members of other user groups
  - Magit
    - Basic tutorial
    - New v2.0 features
  - org-mode
    - Literate programming
    - Organizing tasks and agendas
  - micro-optimizations
  - Beginning tutorials or introductions?

  We decided that Magit would be a great first presentation and Howard
  and Will will tag team this one.
